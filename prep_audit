# Before attacking. Pre scan work. Use VPN, proxychains, change macaddr, use nmap, etc..

Steps:
1) Change dns servers, use proxy to hide IP, set-up VPN for extra protection
2) Use nmap and other tools

# Change DNS resolver, use cloudflare or openvpn

Cloudflare, 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1

# nmap

nmap - useful to find out info in the surrounding area or check a domain/webiste, IP addr

# proxychains, good website for proxies=https://spys.one/en/

proxychains(4) - useful to run any program/service through proxies to help hide identity.

eg.

proxychains4 firefox (can type in domain to go directly to it)

proxychains4 aircrack-ng etc...

# macchanger, very easy to use

macchanger --parameters

# use free or paid vpns, good website
